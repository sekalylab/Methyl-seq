The C++ program calculates CpG site methylation across the entire genome based on a pileup file
compiling:
g++ methyl-seq-level.C

usage:
methyl-seq-level hg19/hg19.CpG.sites.list out2  /scratch/users/lxm416/RAROproject_Methylome/583266_1-TN/583266_1-TN.1million.pileup TN 20

The file lists CpG site position across the entire genome
$ head hg19/hg19.CpG.sites.list
chr	pos	base
chr10	60025	CG
chr10	60089	CG
chr10	60109	CG

out2 is an output file name. It lists methylation for every CpG site across the entire genome.
